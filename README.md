# ARCHITECTURE-METHOD

A living, updatable methodology for modern software architecture, designed to integrate with BMAD-method and Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. This repository serves as a standard reference for Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and architecture planning.

## Philosophy

This methodology is founded on the core principle that **simplicity is the best architecture**. It advocates for a pragmatic approach where the architect acts as a guardian against unnecessary complexity, making informed decisions based on context rather than dogma. Every component and decision must be justified, and the primary goal is to build systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.

This repository is inspired by the "Modern Architecture 101" presentation by Jerry Nixon at NDC Copenhagen 2025 and is designed to be a continuously evolving resource, updated with learnings from every project.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is structured to guide you through the architectural decision-making process, from high-level principles to specific technology choices. It is intended to be used as:

1.  **A Reference Guide:** For understanding modern architectural patterns and principles.
2.  **A Decision Framework:** To standardize how architectural decisions are made and documented.
3.  **A Template Library:** For creating consistent PRDs and architecture plans.
4.  **A Living Document:** To be updated and improved with insights from each new project.

## Repository Structure

-   **/core-principles**: The foundational beliefs of this methodology. These are the high-level concepts that should guide all architectural thinking.
-   **/architecture-patterns**: Descriptions and analysis of common architectural patterns, including the modern full-stack architecture.
-   **/technology-stacks**: Guidance on choosing languages, frameworks, and tooling for your projects.
-   **/decision-frameworks**: Tools and templates for making and documenting architectural decisions, including Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
-   **/prd-templates**: Standardized templates to ensure architectural considerations are integrated into the product planning process.
-   **/tdd-integration**: Best practices for integrating this architectural methodology with Test-Driven Development.
-   **/examples**: Concrete examples of how to apply these principles in real-world scenarios.
-   **/diagrams**: A collection of reference diagrams and the source slides from the presentation.
-   **/.bible**: Core integration documents, including how this methodology complements the BMAD-method.

## Contribution

This is a living methodology. Contributions and updates based on project learnings are not just welcome; they are essential. Follow the process outlined in the `decision-frameworks` to propose and document changes.
